This Mini Message Board app is a project I completed as part of the Odin Project curriculum to practice my Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL skills. I utilized concepts such as routes, controllers, and views, while also keeping in mind good practices for keeping my code clean and scalable. While the project initially was set up to store messages in an array that would reset each time the server was restarted, I refactored my code in a later lesson to utilize a hosted database (Neon) with PostgreSQL in order to save all messages entered in the application.
